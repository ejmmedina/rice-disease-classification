# The Rice is Right: Early Detection of Rice Leaf Disease using Convolutional Neural Networks
##### Machine Learning 2.0 project by Justine Bu&ntilde;o, Elijah Justin Medina & Raphael Mari Ongleo

This study aims to help farmers by early detection of disease through rice leaf image processing using convolutional neural networks. The model is trained on the Rice Disease Image Dataset by Huy Minh Do which includes over 3000 rice leaf images. Over 4 categories: Leaf Blast, Brown Spot, Hispa, and Healthy; the model performs well at 78.2% accuracy. We also looked at how it performs on classifying a healthy rice leaf and found that the model performed even better at 92.2%. Furthermore, we saw that the model is capable even for cases where the symptoms of the disease are still very small. This model gives farmers ample time to potentially save their crops, have better yield, and save cost from fertilizers and pesticides.

##### Data

The data used in this analysis is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/minhhuy2810/rice-diseases-image-dataset/version/1?fbclid=IwAR3QwbQzFpHLe_KCelIbrrMB4kwaBfhzJhrcqLwX7DEOJmLfkI4ZRF2le4U">Rice Diseases Image Dataset</a> from Kaggle. The data consists of listings from 2015 to 2019 amounting to about 16 million rows with 106 features, comprising a total of 85GB. Due to the size of the data, it is not included in the repository.
